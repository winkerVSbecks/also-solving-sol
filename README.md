# Also Solving Sol

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run sketch src/sketches/<sketch-name>.js`

Uses [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) to start a development server that handles browser reload on file save, high-quality PNG exporting, and other features.
